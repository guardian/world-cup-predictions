Then simply type your predicted final score into the boxes beneath all matches listed below. Your predictions will be saved but you can change them until a game kicks off. Matching an exact score bags you X points but correctly predicting the winning team or calling a draw still gets you X point(s). As the tournament unfolds we'll email you your updated score and you can compare your predictive prowess with the combined performance of all those playing the game by signing back in at any time.</p>
